# Blinkit-PowerBi-Dashboard
My first PowerBi project which provided me with valuable hands-on experience in leveraging DAX functions for data analysis and visualization. Through this project, I gained practical knowledge of creating and using slicers to enable dynamic filtering and improve interactivity.Additionally, I worked on calculating essential metrics such as Year-To-Date(YTD) and Month-To-Date(MTD) data,which helped me understand real-world applications of time-based analysis and enhanced my ability to deliver meaningful insights through dashboards.
